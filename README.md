# day-planner

## Description

This is a simple web page that allows users to enter scheduled events throughout their day. The current day is listed at the top of the page. Below that the events for that day are listed in time blocks for each hour of the work day. The user can click on these sections to input a scheduled event. As the day progresses and the hours pass, the time blocks will change color. Grey blocks indicate hours that have passed. Red indicates the current hour and green indicates future hours.

## Usage

The user can click on the time block sections to input a scheduled event. As the day progresses and the hours pass, the time blocks will change color. Grey blocks indicate hours that have passed. Red indicates the current hour and green indicates future hours.
